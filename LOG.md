# wpd Rust rewrite — log

A running record of decisions, milestones, measurements and techniques for
porting wpd from C to Rust. Newest entries go at the bottom of each section.

## Goals

1. **Memory safety in the core.** `crates/wpd` compiles under
   `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` when built without assembly, so a consumer can
   produce a decoder that is provably free of memory-unsafety by construction.
   With assembly on, `unsafe` exists in exactly one module (`wpd::asm`) and in
   the C ABI shim crate.
2. **No perf regression.** The hot paths are assembly, so the safe scalar
   fallbacks do not have to beat C — assembly closes the gap. Where a safe
   formulation costs measurable speed on a path assembly does not cover, that is
   recorded here along with what was done about it.
3. **No feature or correctness regression.** The public C ABI in `include/wpd.h`
   stays byte-for-byte compatible, and every existing test keeps passing.
4. **Runtime asm dispatch preserved**, including the `wpd_set_cpu_flags_mask`
   override checkasm depends on.
5. **A safe idiomatic Rust API** alongside the C ABI.

## Decisions

| Decision                                                           | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cargo + `build.rs` drives the library; Meson keeps the C harnesses | rav1d-proven. Gives clippy, miri, `cargo fuzz` and a normal Rust dependency story. Meson still owns `tools/wpd.c`, `tests/api.c`, `tests/parity.c`, checkasm and the testdata matrix. |
| Two crates: `wpd` (core rlib) and `wpd-capi` (staticlib + cdylib)  | The "provably safe" claim needs the raw-pointer C ABI out of the core. A Rust consumer taking the `wpd` rlib with `--no-default-features` gets a decoder with zero `unsafe` anywhere. |
| Zero `unsafe` in the core; assembly makes up any perf gap          | The security argument is the point of the rewrite. Scalar fallbacks that lose a few percent to C are acceptable because assembly covers the hot paths on every supported target.      |
| `build.rs` for the assembly lives in `wpd`, not `wpd-capi`         | Otherwise a pure-Rust consumer of the `wpd` rlib with `asm` enabled would fail to link.                                                                                               |
| Split `wpd_decoder.c` into C modules before porting                | Porting a 5332-line file wholesale is where this kind of project goes sideways. Six ~900-line modules with the parity suite green between each is a much more forgiving shape.        |
| Two-tier DSP tables (see below)                                    | Lets the core stay safe while `tests/checkasm/*.c` compiles untouched and still benchmarks the raw assembly symbols.                                                                  |

## Two-tier DSP tables

The design that reconciles "safe core" with "honest checkasm".

**Tier A — safe table** (`crates/wpd/src/dsp/`). Fields are safe Rust `fn`
pointers over slices, e.g. `pred_add: [fn(&[u32], &[u32], &mut [u32]); 14]`.
Fallbacks are ordinary safe functions. Assembly entries are safe `fn` items
whose body is a single `unsafe` block in `wpd::asm`, guarded by length
assertions covering the reads the assembly makes past the nominal row
(`upper[-1]`, `upper[num_pixels]`). The decoder only ever sees Tier A, so it
contains no `unsafe` at all.

**Tier B — C ABI table** (`crates/wpd-capi`, `#[cfg(feature = "checkasm")]`).
`#[repr(C)]`, field-for-field identical to `src/vp8l_dsp.h`, `src/vp8dsp.h` and
`src/yuvdsp.h`, so the checkasm tests compile unchanged. Assembly entries are
the **raw assembly symbols** — no wrapper, so `--bench` numbers stay honest.
Fallback entries are thin `extern "C"` trampolines around Tier A; that cost
lands on the reference side, where it affects neither correctness nor the
assembly benchmark.

Both tiers are emitted from one `dsp_table!` macro, so the CPU-flag dispatch
conditions have a single source of truth.

## Safe-and-fast playbook

Techniques for keeping the core free of `unsafe` without paying for it. Grown as
the port proceeds.

- **Flat buffers addressed by offset, never per-row slices.** A plane is one
  allocation (`Vec<u8>`) plus stride, width, height and the existing 64-byte
  trailing padding. Because rows are contiguous, the deliberate out-of-row
  accesses in the C — `out[-1]` and `upper[-1]` in `pred_add_1`, and the
  `upper[width] = row[0]` write in `predictor_transform_rows` — become ordinary
  in-bounds indices into the backing buffer. No `unsafe`, no behaviour change.
- **Caller-owned memory never enters the core.** `wpd_decoder_update`,
  `wpd_decoder_open_borrowed` and `wpd_decoder_set_output_buffer` hand over
  pointers whose lifetime the C ABI cannot express. `wpd-capi` stores
  `(ptr, len, stride)` and rebuilds the slice per call inside `unsafe`; the core
  takes the slice as an argument and stores nothing borrowed.
- **Reslice before a masked index.** `let t = &table[..=mask]; t[idx & mask]`
  lets LLVM prove the bound away. Used for the Huffman root/secondary tables.
- **Fixed-width loads.** `u64::from_be_bytes(s[i..i + 8].try_into().unwrap())`
  compiles to a single load; this is how the range-coder refill and the bit
  reader's prefetch avoid both `unsafe` and a byte loop.
- **`chunks_exact(4)` / `chunks_exact_mut(4)`** for pixel loops,
  `copy_from_slice` for memcpy, `split_at_mut` for provably disjoint copies.
- **`vec![0u8; n]`** for the `wpd_mallocz` equivalent: it routes to
  `alloc_zeroed`, i.e. calloc, which earlier benchmarking already found beats
  `aligned_alloc` + `memset` here.
- **Intrinsic replacements.** `__builtin_clz` → `leading_zeros()`,
  `__builtin_bswap64` → `swap_bytes()`.
- **Check the disassembly, not the theory.** Hot functions are checked for
  surviving `core::panicking` references; a bounds check that LLVM did not
  remove shows up there.

## Perf risk register

Spots where a safe formulation might cost speed and assembly does not cover.
Each gets a measurement at the phase that ports it.

| # | Risk                                                         | Status  |

## Milestones

### Phase 0a — baseline established (commit `d241ef8`)

The pre-port C build is the reference for everything that follows.

- `meson test -C build` with `-Dtestdata_tests=true`: **187/187 pass**.
- `./build/checkasm`: **151/151 pass** (SSE, SSE2, SSSE3, SSE4.1, AVX2 on this
  host).
- Baseline binary preserved at `build-baseline/wpd`, statically linked against
  `libwpd` so it stays valid as the tree changes. `build-baseline/COMMIT`
  records the commit it came from.

Baseline decode timings on this host (`--repeat 48`, hyperfine, 12 runs, release
build, x86-64 with AVX2):

| File                  | Mean           |
| --------------------- | -------------- |
| `lossless.webp`       | 160.9 ms ± 2.2 |
| `lossy.webp`          | 169.2 ms ± 2.2 |
| `anim_yuva.webp`      | 341.3 ms ± 2.3 |
| `simplelf-lossy.webp` | 160.8 ms ± 2.3 |

Note on A/B methodology: checkasm benchmark comparisons must be made within a
single build directory — comparing binaries linked in different build dirs has
previously produced a spurious ~5% swing. End-to-end `cmpbench.sh` comparisons
use the preserved statically-linked baseline binary, which does not have that
problem.

### Phase 0b — `wpd_decoder.c` split into modules

Pure code motion in C, so that the port can proceed a module at a time rather
than swapping a 5332-line translation unit in one commit. Separable translation
units are load-bearing for the mixed-language build: with the file monolithic
there is no way to port "just the Huffman part".

| Module          | Lines | Contents                                                     |
| --------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `wpd_decoder.c` | 1248  | public API, streaming input buffer                           |
| `vp8l.c`        | 1059  | lossless entropy decode, the four transforms, still driver   |
| `convert.c`     | 612   | format helpers, crop/scale/flip, conversion, region blending |
| `export.c`      | 477   | frame export, caller-owned output buffers                    |
| `container.c`   | 413   | RIFF scan, frame table, `wpd_get_info`                       |
| `anim.c`        | 365   | compositor, canvas, `decode_anmf`                            |
| `huffman.c`     | 367   | prefix-code table build, code-length list readers            |
| `lossy.c`       | 236   | lossy still/alpha driver                                     |
| `image.c`       | 102   | `WebPImage` allocation                                       |

Headers: `wpd_internal.h` (shared helpers), `bitreader.h` (header-only),
`huffman.h`, `image.h`, `container.h`, `vp8l.h`, `wpd_dec.h` (the decoder
struct), plus a header per module for the symbols that cross a boundary.

Two things stayed inline rather than moving into a `.c`: the whole bit reader,
because `br_bits()` sits in the lossless pixel loop and its refill machinery has
to be visible at the call site, and `huff_read_symbol()` for the same reason.
`read_huffman_code_simple`/`_normal` took a `WPDDecoder` only to reach `s->gb`,
so they now take the `LEBitReader` directly and moved with the rest of the
Huffman code.

Verification against the preserved baseline: 187/187 meson tests, checkasm
151/151, `md5check.sh` bit-identical, `animcheck.sh` clean over 42 files × 8
packed formats and 27 animations, `rac32.sh` 187/187, no new compiler warnings.

Timings, same methodology as Phase 0a:

| File                  | Baseline | After split | Delta |
| --------------------- | -------- | ----------- | ----- |
| `lossless.webp`       | 160.6 ms | 160.4 ms    | -0.1% |
| `lossy.webp`          | 169.5 ms | 170.0 ms    | +0.3% |
| `anim_yuva.webp`      | 341.5 ms | 342.9 ms    | +0.4% |
| `simplelf-lossy.webp` | 159.5 ms | 160.2 ms    | +0.4% |

All within run-to-run noise: the extra translation units cost nothing, so no
interim LTO is needed to keep the port's own measurements honest.
